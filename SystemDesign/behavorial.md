# During Interview
- If you know the ans don't skip over clarfying the question completely, you don't want to answer the questions the other people didn't even want to know about.
  - Mistake made in Oyo, did a high level system design, where they wanted a simple low level design. Tried to be arrogant I guess.
- Don't be too arrogant, again as in Oyo and also in Ciena interview.
- Try to drive the interview into what you know.
- Don't burn your chips in the beginning.
- Keep checking in with the interviewer.
- Try to moonshot ideas, and also save super moonshoot ideas at the end.

## System Design
- Pause and think sometimes, even if you know.
- Ask as many questions as possible.
- Throughtout the interview checkin with the interviewer.(Do you want me to go into further details.).
- Pivot your answer, if your answer is wrong. now I realise the answer that I gave isn't going in the direction I was going.
