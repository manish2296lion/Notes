* ### Local port forwarding
    If you don't have access to some site say imgur.com but you have access to a remotehost which has access to imgur you can perform local port forwarding to access the site. The key here is -L which says weâ€™re doing local port forwarding. -N prevents disconnection. Forward user's local port 9000 to imgur.com at port 80 on server/remotehost.

            ssh -L -N 9000:imgur.com:80 user@remotehost

     If you need to access a port on your server which can only be accessed from localhost and not remotely. Forward user's local port 9000 to port 5432 on the server.

             ssh -L -N 9000:localhost:5432 user@example.com

* ### Remote port forwarding
