# Var in Java 10
- In Java 10, the var keyword allows local variable type inference, which means the type for the local variable will be inferred by the compiler, so you donâ€™t need to declare that.
- Instead of 
  ```java
  MAP<String,String> map=new HashMap<String,String>(); 
  MAP<User,List<String>> listofMovies=new HashMap<>();
  ```
  you can now use

  ```java
  var map=new HashMap<String,String>();
  var listofMovies=new HashMap<User,List<String>>();
  ```
- Each statement containing the var keyword has a static type which is the declared type of value(Unlike in js). This means that assigning a value of a different type will always fail. 
  ```java
  var id=0;// At this moment, compiler interprets 
  //variable id as integer.
  id="34"; // This will result in compilation error 
  //because of incompatible types: java.lang.String 
  //can't be converted to int.
  ```

- You cannot initialize a var variable to null. 
- polymorphic behavior does not work with the var keyword. Say doctor and engineer inherit the person class. You can't do
  ```java
  var p=new Doctor(); // In this case, what should be
  //the type of p; it is Doctor or Person?
  p=new Engineer(); // Compilation error saying
  //incompatible types
  ```
