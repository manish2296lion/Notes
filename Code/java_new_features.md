# Var in Java 10
- In Java 10, the var keyword allows local variable type inference, which means the type for the local variable will be inferred by the compiler, so you donâ€™t need to declare that.
- Instead of 
  ```java
  MAP<String,String> map=new HashMap<String,String>(); 
  MAP<User,List<String>> listofMovies=new HashMap<>();
  ```
  you can now use

  ```java
  var map=new HashMap<String,String>();
  var listofMovies=new HashMap<User,List<String>>();
  ```
- Each statement containing the var keyword has a static type which is the declared type of value(Unlike in js). This means that assigning a value of a different type will always fail. 
  ```java
  var id=0;// At this moment, compiler interprets 
  //variable id as integer.
  id="34"; // This will result in compilation error 
  //because of incompatible types: java.lang.String 
  //can't be converted to int.
  ```

- You cannot initialize a var variable to null. 
- polymorphic behavior does not work with the var keyword. Say doctor and engineer inherit the person class. You can't do
  ```java
  var p=new Doctor(); // In this case, what should be
  //the type of p; it is Doctor or Person?
  p=new Engineer(); // Compilation error saying
  //incompatible types
  ```

# Functional Interfaces
- An interface with only a single abstract method. Can have multiple default implementations.
- Comparator interface is a functional interface

```java
public interface PrintInterface {
    void printMe(String message);
    default void sampleDefaultImplementation(){
        System.out.println("Just to show you can have
         default implementation inside the interfaces and still be called functional interfaces");
    }
}
```
## Built-In Functional Interfaces

### Consumer Interface
- Takes a single argument and returns no result.
```void accept(T t)```
- Powerful, Can write code like
```java
  List<Integer> list = List.of(1,2,3,4,56,78,8);
  list.forEach(System.out::println);
```

#### Chaining Consumers using andThen
- We can chain multiple consumer interfaces together to occur one after the other, say there is a list of strings and we want to first print them as is, and then print them in upperCase:
- andThen also returns another consumer so you can call andThen again and keep doing.
```java
  List<String> list = List.of("a", "b", "c", "d", "e");
  Consumer<String> print = System.out::println; //Method reference
  Consumer<String> printUpperCase = item -> System.out.println(item.toUpperCase(Locale.ROOT));
  list.forEach(print.andThen(printUpperCase).andThen(print));//
```

### Supplier Interface
- Takes no input and supplies a value.

```java
  Supplier<Double> randomGenerator = Math::random; //Method reference
  //Could also have done ()->return Math.random(); // lambda way
  System.out.println(randomGenerator.get());
```

### Function Interface
- Map a value to different Value.
```java
  Function<String, Integer> map = str -> str.length();
  System.out.println(map.apply("Happy new year"));
```

### Composing Function Interface
```java
  Function<String, String> replaceColon = str -> str.replace(':', '=');
  Function<String, String> addBraces = str -> '{' + str + '}';

  Function<String,String> combinedFunction = replaceColon
                                              .andThen(addBraces);
  
  System.out.println(combinedFunction.apply("This is the sample string : Hello"));
```

### Predicate Interaface
- Takes a condition and returns a boolean to signify if the condition is true or false.
```java
  Predicate<String> isLongerThanFive = str -> str.length()>5;
  System.out.println(isLongerThanFive.test("Hello"));
```

# Lambda
- Functional Interfaces + Anonymous Classes + Syntanctic Sugar = Lambda Interfaces.
- Will return an instance/object of the anonymous class whose single non default abstract method's implementation is within lambda's implementation. 
- Lambda doesn't require the type of parameter.
- Lambda doesn't require the ```()``` brackets if there is a single parameter, only when there are no parameter or more than one parameter then it requires the ```()``` brackets
- Lambda also doesn't require the ```{}``` brackets if the body of the method contains a single statement.
- Return keyword is not needed in lambda, if it can be derived from context.
  ```java
    Printer p = x -> System.out.println(x);
  ```
  ```java
    SomeRandomInterface p = (x,y) -> {
      someRandomMethod(x);
      someOtherRandomMethod(y);
    }
  ```
- In the lambda expression, we can access the local variables in the enclosing method.
- We can access static fields in the enclosing class, if it is a static method, and both instance fields and static fields in case of non static methods.
- The value of this in lambda classes represent the current instance of the class containing the non static method which invoked the lambda.
- You cannot change the value of fields (local/static/instance fields) that you capture, inside the lambda.

## Method References : V.IMPORTANT
- The lambdas which can be implemented in a single line can also be replaced by a method reference.
- They can be very useful in spawning threads, see the example below.
- It is important to know a method reference is also a lambda expression so it creates an object of type functional interface.
  ```java
  PrintInterface p = System.out::println; 
  //same as Printer p = x -> System.out.println(x);
  ```
- Method reference is used to refer method of functional interface.
- It is compact and easy form of lambda expression.
- You can convert to method reference from intelliJ (Alt + Enter)
### There are following types of method references in java:
#### Reference to a Static Method
- ```ContainingClass::staticMethodName```
- Ex : ```System.out::println```
```java
public class MethodReference2 {  
    public static void ThreadStatus(){  
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");  
    }  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        Thread t2=new Thread(MethodReference2::ThreadStatus);  
        t2.start();       
    }  
}
```

#### Reference to an Instance Method
- ```containingObject::instanceMethodName```
```java
public class InstanceMethodReference2 {  
    public void printnMsg(){  
        System.out.println("Hello, this is instance method");  
    }  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
    Thread t2=new Thread(new InstanceMethodReference2()::printnMsg);  
        t2.start();       
    }  
}  
```

#### Reference to a Constructor
- Tricky to understand, in the below example when the getMessage is invoked, it essentially creates a new object of Message Object.
- ```ClassName::new```
```java
interface Messageable{  
    Message getMessage(String msg);  
}  
class Message{  
    Message(String msg){  
        System.out.print(msg);  
    }  
}  
public class ConstructorReference {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        Messageable hello = Message::new;  
        hello.getMessage("Hello");  
    }  
}  
```


## Differences between anonymous class vs lambda
### The value of this.
- In case of lambda, this represent the current instance of the class containing the non static method which invoked lambda.
- In case of anonymous classes, this represent the instance of the anonymous class.
### Instance fields
- We cannot have state inside the lambda expression, so there are no fields.
- Anonymous inner class can have state, and thus have instance fields.

```java
public class LambdaDemo {
    int x = 1;
    public void nonStaticShow(){
        greet(x -> System.out.println(x + this.x));

        greet(new PrintInterface() {
            int r = 2;
            @Override
            public void printMe(String message) {
                System.out.println(this.r);
            }
        });
    }

    public static void greet(PrintInterface printer){
        printer.printMe("Hello from Lambda Demo");
    }
}

```
