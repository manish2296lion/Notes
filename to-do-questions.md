- Find the running median of integer stream.  
- There are some villages near a city in India that have yet to be connected to the city via road. Some villages are connected to each other via road and some aren’t. A village is said to be connected to the city if one can travel from that village to the city via any road.The cost of making a road between a city and a village and that of between a village and another village is the same and equal to 1 unit.Find the minimum cost the government must bear in order to connect all the villages to the city.Input: N: number of villages. Matrix: M[N+1][N+1] where 0 to N-1 indexes represents a village and the Nth index represents a city. M[x][y] = M[y][x] = 1 if there is a road between x and y.  
//- merge k lists
- find an element in a sorted 2d matrix
//- Given a bitonic array, find the maximum element(i.e., Bitonic element) and its space-time complexity.  
- Given an array of prices for a stock, find the maximum profit you can make. You're allowed to buy one share as we go along or sell all the shares.  
//- Given a BST, find any 2 nodes whose sum is equal to a given number.   : Two Sum
- Minimum removals from array to make max – min <= K
- List of ratio given and need give the answer to m queries Example :Given list [ a:b = 3, c:d = 4, g:h = 10, b:c = 8 ]
